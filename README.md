<h1 align="center">Twitter Sentiment Analysis</h1>

</p>

Sentiment analysis employs machine learning to automatically discern the tone and attitude with which people discuss a specific subject. Its primary application involves determining the polarity of textual data, enabling the automatic identification of whether a tweet, product review, or support ticket expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment toward the discussed topic.

Attentively listening to customers is crucial for uncovering valuable insights on how to enhance your product or service. While feedback can come from various sources like surveys or public reviews, Twitter provides unfiltered and direct insights into what your audience truly thinks about your offering. For instance, customers might express appreciation for the simplicity of the user interface but express frustration with the perceived slowness of customer support. 

Twitter, with its real-time and candid nature, can offer a transparent view of customer sentiments that can be instrumental in refining and optimizing your business.

Using the Twitter API, 1.6 million tweets were extracted to create Sentiment140 dataset (http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students). I pruned to 160000 records to improve model construction and sentiment analysis. The tweets were annotated (0 = Negative, 4 = Positive) and can be used to detect sentiment.
